## My process

CSS with SASS, I used grid and flexbox. Vanilla Javascript.

- When we choose a rating and submit it, the" thank you card" will be display with our rating number. - When we select a rating button, it turns gray. If we choose another button, the gray will be removed on the other button.
- When we click on the thank you card again, we return to the rating card.

### Built with
